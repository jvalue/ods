# Open Data Service - Pipeline-Service

## Build

`npm install`

`npm run tsc`

## Run

`npm start`

## Running in watch mode

Use `npm run watch` to concurrently start the `tsc` compiler as well as run the service. It automatically reloads after file changes.

## Running unit tests

Use `npm test` to run the unit tests. There is also `nrm run watch-test` available to start `jest` in "watch mode".

## Running end-to-end tests

* For integration testing run `docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ../docker-compose.it.yml --env-file ../.env up pipeline-it`.
  
* To analyze the logs of the service under test we recommend using lazydocker. Alternatively, you can attach manually to the pipeline container using the docker cli. 

* After running integration tests dependant services (e.g. rabbit-mq) keep running. In order to stop all services and return to a clean, initial state run `docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ../docker-compose.it.yml down`.
