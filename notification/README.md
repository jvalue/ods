# Open Data Service - Notification-Service

## Build

`npm install`

`npm run transpile`

## Run

`npm start`

## Running unit tests

Use `npm test` to run the unit tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

* For integration testing run 
  
  ```docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ../docker-compose.it.yml --env-file ../.env up notification-it```

* To analyze the logs of the service under test we recommend using lazydocker. Alternatively, you can attach manually to the notification container using the docker cli. 

* After running integration tests dependant services (e.g. rabbit-mq) keep running. In order to stop all services and return to a clean, initial state run 
  
  ```docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ../docker-compose.it.yml down```.

### NotificationWriteModel
Base model:

  "condition": string,
  "type": "WEBHOOK" | "SLACK" | "FCM",
  "parameter": {
    ... see below
  }
}
```

Parameter for a webhook notification: 
```
"parameter": {
    "url": string
}
```

```
"parameter": {
    "workspaceId": string
    "channelId": string
    "secret": string
}
```


Parameter for a firebase notification: 
```

    "projectId": string
    "clientEmail": string
    "privateKey": string

```

### Slack notification walkthrough
* Create a slack app for your slack channel and enable activations as discribed [here](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
* Determine your apps' incoming webhook url at the slack [dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps).
* POST a slackRequest under the endpoint ```/configs```. The workspaceId, channelId and secret fields can be taken from the parts of the incoming webhook url (separated by '/', in the given order).
* Go to your configured channel and be stunned by the magic.
