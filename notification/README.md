  "condition": string,
  "type": "WEBHOOK" | "SLACK" | "FCM",
  "parameter": {
    ... see below
  }
}
```

Parameter for a webhook notification: 
```

    "workspaceId": string
    "channelId": string
    "secret": string
}
```

### Slack notification walkthrough
* Create a slack app for your slack channel and enable activations as discribed [here](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
* Determine your apps' incoming webhook url at the slack [dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps).
* POST a slackRequest under the endpoint ```/configs```. The workspaceId, channelId and secret fields can be taken from the parts of the incoming webhook url (separated by '/', in the given order).
* Go to your configured channel and be stunned by the magic.
